# Design Patterns - C++
Here i will dive into some design patterns

### What are design patterns?
- A general repeatable solution for a commonly occurring problem in software design.
- They are thoroughly tested and widely used as well as language neutral and supports object orientation.

### 1. Factory Design Pattern (FDP)
- It creates objects for you rather than initiating objects directly. It is also known as a virtual constructor. Basically we define a function in that class to instantiate all the required values and return the object as a result. Define an interface or an abstarct class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to initiate.
